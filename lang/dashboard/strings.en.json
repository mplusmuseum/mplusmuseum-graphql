    "graphql-about-1": "GraphQL is a data query language you'll use to request information from the M+ data store. Traditionally GraphQL allows two types of operations, <em>queries</em> and <em>mutations</em> these can be thought of as <em>read</em> and <em>write</em> operations.",
    "graphql-about-2": "As well as one more operation called <em><a href=\"#introspection\">introspection</a></em>, which allows you to ask the GraphQL endpoint about itself.",
    "graphql-about-3": "Below you will find examples of various calls to can make to the GraphQL endpoint.",
    "graphql-communicating-1": "The single endpoint for all GraphQL calls is...",
    "graphql-communicating-2": "GraphQL operations consist of multiline JSON, an example \"Hello World\" GraphQL query is show below:",
    "graphql-communicating-3": "To query GraphQL using cURL, make a <code>POST</code> request with a JSON payload as <code>--data-binary</code>. You must also include your API token as <code>bearer</code> authorization.",
    "graphql-communicating-4": "Using Nodejs it may look like this, making sure to pass in your API token as a <code>bearer</code> token as shown.",
    "graphql-communicating-5": "Probably the easiest way to try out GraphQL queries is to use the playground which can be found here:",
    "graphql-communicating-6": "You can see an example by clicking the \"run in the playground\" link, you will need to press the \"run\" button to see the results of the query.",
    "graphql-communicating-7": "Below you'll find a list of the current queries you can make against the data store.",
    "run-in-playground": "Run in the playground",
    "graphql-introspection-1": "The <em>introspection</em> operation is the only operation you can call using <code>GET</code>. Introspection allows you to query the GraphQL schema for details about itself. Query <code class=\"red\">__schema</code> to list all types defined in the schema and get details about each:",
    "graphql-introspection-2": "Query <code class=\"red\">__type</code> to get details about any type:",
    "graphql-objects-1": "This query selects all of the objects and can be filtered by certain fields shown below. Note: filters are <em>additive</em> rather than <em>or</em>, filtering two fields will only return records that match both.",
    "graphql-objects-2": "Valid filters are: <code class=\"red\">page</code>, <code class=\"red\">per_page</code>, <code class=\"red\">[ids]</code>, <code class=\"red\">lang</code>, <code class=\"red\">sort</code>, <code class=\"red\">sort_field</code>, <code class=\"red\">objectNumber</code>, <code class=\"red\">area</code>, <code class=\"red\">category</code>, <code class=\"red\">archivalLevel</code>, <code class=\"red\">medium</code>, <code class=\"red\">title</code>, <code class=\"red\">displayDate</code>, <code class=\"red\">beginDate</code>, <code class=\"red\">endDate</code>, <code class=\"red\">constituent</code>, <code class=\"red\">[constituents]</code>, <code class=\"red\">exhibition</code>, and <code class=\"red\">keyword</code>",

    "valid-lang": "The only valid values for <code class=\"red\">lang</code> are <code>en</code>, and <code>zh-hant</code>. The default is <code>en</code>, if a record doesn't have values that match the selected language then it'll return the <code>en</code> version if there is one.",
    "graphql-objects-5": "Here is the simplest call to get all object ids",
    "object-pagination": "Here we are asking for slightly more information, note how we can use the <code class=\"red\">per_page</code> filter to limit the number of results.",
    "object-sort-example": "Here is an example of sorting by <code>sortNumber</code>.",
    "object-by-ids-example": "You can also ask for specific objects by passing in an array of <code class=\"red\">ids</code>.",
    "object-1": "You can get a single object by passing in the <code class=\"red\">id</code> parameter. Here we are showing <em>all</em> the fields possible.",
    "areas-1": "You can fetch all the valid areas which you can then use to filter objects by. For example running the query below will return a handful of areas, which you would then use in an Object query with <code>(area: \"xxxxxxxx\")</code> where \"xxxxxxxx\" is one of the areas returned by this query.",
    "aggs-filters": "Valid filters are <code class=\"red\">page</code>, <code class=\"red\">per_page</code>, <code class=\"red\">lang</code>, <code class=\"red\">sort</code> and <code class=\"red\">sort_field</code>.",
    "aggs-sort": "Valid values for the <code class=\"red\">sort_field</code> are <code>title</code> and <code>count</code>. Valid values for the <code class=\"red\">sort</code> are <code>asc</code> and <code>desc</code>.",
    "aggs-per-page": "The <code class=\"red\">per_page</code> filter will limit the number of results, for example <code>(per_page: 10)</code> will return just 10 records. Unlike Objects you cannot paginate through the this data set.",
    "category-1": "You can fetch all the valid categories which you can then use to filter objects by. For example running the query below will return a handful of categories, which you would then use in an Object query with <code>(category: \"xxxxxxxx\")</code> where \"xxxxxxxx\" is one of the categories returned by this query.",
    "medium-1": "You can fetch all the valid mediums which you can then use to filter objects by. For example running the query below will return a handful of mediums, which you would then use in an Object query with <code>(medium: \"xxxxxxxx\")</code> where \"xxxxxxxx\" is one of the mediums returned by this query.",
    "archivalLevel-1": "You can fetch all the valid archival levels which you can then use to filter objects by. For example running the query below will return a handful of levels, which you would then use in an Object query with <code>(archivalLevel: \"xxxxxxxx\")</code> where \"xxxxxxxx\" is one of the level returned by this query.",
    "constituents-1": "Constituents are people and institutions connected to an object, for example they may be the artists or the seller or buyer, they may be the curator or the institution the displays the object.",
    "constituents-2": "This query selects all of the constituents and can be filtered by certain fields shown below. Note: filters are <em>additive</em> rather than <em>or</em>, filtering two fields will only return records that match both.",
    "constituents-filters": "Valid filters are: <code class=\"red\">page</code>, <code class=\"red\">per_page</code>, <code class=\"red\">sort_field</code>, <code class=\"red\">sort</code>, <code class=\"red\">[ids]</code>, <code class=\"red\">gender</code>, <code class=\"red\">name</code>, <code class=\"red\">gender</code>, <code class=\"red\">beginDate</code>, <code class=\"red\">endDate</code>, <code class=\"red\">keyword</code>, <code class=\"red\">isMaker</code>, <code class=\"red\">role</code> and <code class=\"red\">lang</code>",
    "constituents-sorts": "Valid values for the <code class=\"red\">sort_field</code> are <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>sortNumber</code>, <code>alphaSortName</code>, <code>gender</code>, <code>beginDate</code>, <code>endDate</code>, <code>objectCount</code> and <code>nationality</code>, values for <code class=\"red\">sort</code> are <code>asc</code> and <code>desc</code>.",
    "constituents-call-for-ids": "Here is the simplest call to get all constituent ids",

    "constituents-by-ids-example": "You can also ask for specific constituents by passing in an array of <code class=\"red\">ids</code>.",
    "constituent-1": "You can get a single constituent by passing in the <code class=\"red\">id</code> parameter. Here we are showing <em>all</em> the fields possible.",
    "nesting-1": "When you are searching for objects you can nest a limited version of constituents in the results. If you are requesting <strong>Objects</strong> you can get the constituents with the following query.",
    "nesting-2": "If you are asking for a single Object then you can get a bit more information about the constituents, see the example below.",
    "nesting-3": "You cannot keep nesting objects and constituents beyond the first two levels, because they would just keep including each other forever.",
    "nesting-4": "You can also next constituents inside objects, but again with limited information returned and only down two levels.",
    "connected-1": "There are two ways to find objects connected to a constituent. If we wanted to find all the objects created by an artist we can run a query to find that artists and request the objects connected to the within the query, as shown below.",
    "connected-2": "You can also do a search on objects using the constituent ID as a filter. The advantage of the second way allows you to filter the results with other filters. The below query shows all the objects curated by a user with a certain medium type."
